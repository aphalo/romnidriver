rOmniDriver 0.1.9
=================

Fix bug: missing formal parameter for ch.index.

rOmniDriver 0.1.8
=================

Add support for multi-channel spectrometers. The changes should not affect any
existing scripts for single-channel instruments. However, it requires a recent 
version of the runtime from Ocean Optics (API version 2.40 or newer).

rOmniDriver 0.1.7
=================

Add several functions needed for more general use. Still many are not implemented
including support for special "features" and triggers.

rOmniDriver 0.1.6
=================

Added function get_integration_time().

rOmniDriver 0.1.5
=================

Added functions get_name and get_serial_number.

rOmniDriver 0.1.4
=================

Rebuilt with R 3.1.0
No .jar files included with package. 
At initialization reads the environment variable set during the OmniDriver 
runtime installation, sets the path for the Java class calls accordingly. 
This means that the package does not include any code from Ocean Optics.

rOmniDriver 0.1.3
=================

Rebuilt with R 3.0.3 and the documentation improved so that the current 
version of roxygen2 does not fail with a fatal error.

rOmniDriver 0.1.2
=================

Working in some simple tests with the Maya2000Pro in the prototype 
of MayaControl.
