# rOmniDriver <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

## Purpose 

The package **rOmniDriver** makes available in R the functions in OmniDriver SDP
from _Ocean Insight_ (formerly _Ocean Optics_). OmniDriver allows to change
settings and acquire spectra using any Ocean Insight USB-connected spectrometer.
It has been tested with _USB2000_, _Maya2000Pro_, _Flame_ and _Jaz_ instruments
under MS-windows 7 and MS-Windows 10, but should also work with any other modern
spectrometer from Ocean Insight, and also under OS X, and Linux. However, only a
subset of all OmniDriver exported functions are implemented (those functions
that write to the instrument EEPROM are not implemented as they require a secret
key for activation, and in addition their use without risk requires a profound
understanding of the instruments' hardware and firmware). In addition most
functions specific to spectrometer models we do not have access to are not
implemented, as we would be unable to test them. As currently the API
documentation is freely available at Ocean Insight' support page, adding
additional functions using the source code of the functions included in our
package as examples is almost trivial. _If you do add new functions, please,
make a pull request and I will add your contributed code to the package, and
your name as contributor to the package in its DESCRIPTION._

Package **ooacquire** provides a high level set of functions for spectral data
acquisition built using this package as a base.

## Installation

In package 'rOmniDriver' (>= 0.1.16), when initialization fails during loading,
option `"rOmniDriver.offline"` is set to `TRUE` so that packages that include
this package in their `Suggests:` can detect whether the connection to Java and
the OmniDriver driver are active or not. This makes it possible to disable
specific functions rather than the dependent package failing to load. The
instructions below are to be followed when on-line access to spectrometers is
needed. If this is not the case, Java and OmniDriver do not need to be
installed, and in some cases not even this package needs to be installed.

OmniDriver from Ocean Insight is written in the computer language Java. To
access the functions in this driver from R, we need to use a bridge between the
two computer languages, which is provided by R package 'rJava' available from
CRAN. 'rJava' requires that the Java JDK, the Java development kit, is
installed. Installing only the Java JRE, the Java runtime environment, is not
enough in this case, although it is for many other programs written in Java. In
other words being able to run other Java programs does not ensure that the
needed JDK is already installed.

Of the different Java implementations, **Oralcle's Java 8 is known to work with
'rJava' and OmniDriver**. The 'rJava' package sometimes fails to work with the
most recent version of the Java JDK, as its updates may lag slightly behind. On
computers with processors and operationg systems like Windows that support two
command sets, 32 bits and 64 bits, and two versions of R are available, the
version of Java installed and the R version used should match, being both of
them 32 bits or 64 bits. As the 32 bit version of R is soon reaching its
end-of-life, sticking to the 64 bit vesrions is a good idea.

Getting R package 'rJava' working is not always straightforward, so one needs to
make sure 'rJava' is correctly installed and functional before attempting to
install `rOmniDriver`. This is important, in case problems occur. Sometimes a
restart of the operating system can help.

On Windows, the R distribution (>= 4.2.0) includes only binary packages and R
binary for the 64-bit architecture and the Java JDK 64 bit is needed. In
contrast, earlier versions of R (<= 4.2.0) installs packages for both 64-bit and
32-bit architectures, which means that using the default R installation and
settings one may need to install also both versions of the JDK. The examples and
documentation for the JDK are not needed to use 'rOmniDriver'. Under Windows, if
the Java installation fails, uninstall and reinstall as administrator.

Depending on the operating system, manually setting the environment variable
`"JAVA_HOME"` may be necessary. We can check if this variable is set either at
the operating system command prompt or from R, as shown here. Windows uses a
"registery" to keep track of the location of programs so even if this variable
is not set, 'rJava' will find the Java JDK under Windows.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("JAVA_HOME")
```

----
At the OS terminal (such as RStudio's Terminal window) we can check the
currently intalled version of the JDK with `javac -version`. Be aware that
`javac` is used for the _JDK_ and `java` for the _JRE_ and for this to work
`javac` must be not only installed, but also in the `path`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
javac -version
```
----

Once Java is installed and tested working, the next step is to install
'OmniDriver' using the installer downloaded from Ocean Insight's downloads web
page corresponding to the operating system you are using. The OmniDriver
installer offers a choice between installing the runtime and the development
version. The runtime is free, and is all what is needed to use R package
'rOmniDriver'. When there is a choice of 32 bit and 64 bit versions, OmniDriver
should match Java and R in this respect. I have done all testing with the 64 bit
version of OmniDriver, together with the 64 bit Java 8 JDK and 64 bit R under
Windows 10. (SPAM is not needed either, so the combined download from Ocean
Insight is overkill.)

After the installation of 'Java' and 'OmniDriver' is done, we are ready for the
installation of the R packages. At this point open a _new R session_, or
_restart an already open R session_. I recommend installing first package
'rJava' from CRAN. This installation may fail if the path (folder on disk) to
the Java installation is not found.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rJava")
```

Once this installation has succeeded, and 'rJava' examples tested to work, we
can install package 'rOmniDriver'. This package is not available through CRAN as
it is a wrapper based on proprietary software from Ocean Insight with no source
code freely available. 'rOmniDriver' can be installed from sources directly from
the Git repository at Github. For this we use package 'remotes' that needs to be
first installed unless it has been previously installed. (Under MS-Windows
installation from sources is possible only after installing Rtools from CRAN.
Under Linux operating systems the requirements for installing R packages from
source are usually but not always met by default. Under OS-X compilers may need
to be installed. This requirements are the same as for installing any R
packages from sources.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("aphalo/romnidriver")
```

The most frequent reason why installation, or functioning of the 'rOmniDriver'
package fails is not finding the path to the installation of OmniDriver. The
'OmniDriver' installer from Ocean Insight is expected to save this path in an
environment variable (in the operating system) called "OOI_HOME", but it not
always does. If necessary we can inspect this variable from within R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("OOI_HOME")
```

The R statement above should show the path to the folder where OmniDriver is
installed. The OmniDriver installer seems to set this variable reliably under
Windows but unreliably under Apple's OS X (Unix) and possibly Linux. If the
variable is undefined or contains an invalid path the user can set or edit it at
the shell prompt or in a shell script run on system start up to point to the
correct folder. Otherwise it can be set within an R script using function
`Sys.setenv(OOI_HOME = <path-to-folder>)` replacing `<path-to-folder>` with
corresponding path. Obviosuly the variable should be set before loading 
'rOmniDriver'. 

If problems are encountered during loading of 'rOmniDriver' a diagnosis message is
displayed. Display of a diagnosis message in the absence of problems can be
forced by setting `OOI_DIAG = "TRUE"` in the operating system before starting R
or by setting R option verbose with `options(verbose = TRUE)` before loading the
package. This will show the location of the `.jar` file loaded and the values of
the environment variables `OOI_HOME` and the path to the OmniDriver `.jar` file.

There is no other set up needed after installation, just plug your spectrometer
to a USB port. The first time you connect an instrument most operating systems
will install the USB drivers automatically, as they are made available by the
'OmniDriver' installation. If this step fails there are different possibilities:
1) the account you are logged-in does not have the permissions needed to install
the driver, 2) the user has no permission to write to the USB port through Java,
or 3) the spectrometer needs a firmware update for compatibility with newer
versions of the operating system (e.g. some USB2000 spectrometers under Windows
versions newer than 7). These problems are operating-system specific and do also
affect the vendor supplied software to control the spectrometer. If you can
control the spectrometer using the 'OceanView' program from Ocean Insight, then
Java and the spectrometer drivers should have been installed and working
correctly. **On the other hand, there is no need for 'OceanView' to be installed
in a computer to be able to use R package 'rOmniDriver' to communicate and
control Ocean Optics/Ocean Insight spectrometers.**

## Documentation

The implemented wrapper functions respect the names of the functions as they
appear in the OmniDriver documentation but replacing "camelCase" with
"snake_case". For a couple of function with very long names, synonyms are
defined in addition to the original names. The documentation for the OmniDriver
API is currently available at
(https://www.oceaninsight.com/globalassets/catalog-blocks-and-images/software-downloads-installers/javadocs-api/omnidriver/index.html).

This package has a vignette, that can be alternatively built with full output
with a spectrometer connected, or in simplified form with the instrument
off-line. A built version of the documentation is available at
(https://docs.r4photobiology.info/rOmniDriver/).

## Package 'ooacquire'

The functions in the OmniDriver SDP are "bare bones" building blocks that can be
used to write scripts directly, e.g. to acquire one scan every few seconds, or
used to create more sophisticated functions for specific protocols and
applications, of which several examples are provided in package
['ooacquire'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/). Package 'ooacquire'
can be installed with this R statement.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("aphalo/ooacquire")
```

## Status of this package and _OmniDriver_

Package 'rOmniDriver' does NOT require _OceanView_ or _SpectraSuite_, the
commercial software from Ocean Insight to be installed, only the free run-time
of OmniDriver. Consequently, it does not require the purchase of software from
Ocean Insight, but users of the driver OmniDriver run-time are not guaranteed
support by Ocean Insight, unless they acquire a license to the OmniDriver SDP.
OmniDriver is proprietary, closed source, software. The R package itself is
open source and released under GPL.

**Recent versions of _OmniDriver_ (2.70.0, 2.71.0) lack some functions in the API
that were included up to version 2.56.0. These newer versions of OmniDriver
no longer recognize the _USB2000_ spectrometer. As documentation is scant, I do
not know if support for some other old models like _USB4000_ has been also
removed.**

Packages 'rOmniDriver' and 'ooacquire' have been developed with the agreement
of Ocean Optics on the condition of they remaining open source and free to use. 
The GPL ensures that any derivative works also respect this agreement.
