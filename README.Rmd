## Purpose 

The package **rOmniDriver** makes available in R the functions in OmniDriver SDP
from _Ocean Insight_ (formerly _Ocean Optics_). OmniDriver allows to change
settings and acquire spectra using any Ocean Optics USB-connected spectrometer.
It has been tested with _USB2000_, _Maya2000Pro_, _Flame_ and _Jaz_ instruments
under MS-windows 7, MS-Windows 10, and MS-Windows 11. It is known to also work
under OS-X, and should also work under Linux. All modern spectrometers from
Ocean Optics, except the very latest ones, are supported by OmniDriver and can
be expected to also work with this package.

R wrappers are implemented for a large subset of the functions exported by
OmniDriver. However, functions that write to the instrument EEPROM are not
implemented as they require a secret key for activation, and, in addition, their
use without risk requires a profound understanding of the instruments' hardware
and firmware. In addition, most functions specific to spectrometer models we do
not have access to are not implemented, as we would be unable to test them. As
currently the API documentation is freely available at Ocean Optics' support
page, adding additional functions using the source code of the functions
included in our package as example is almost trivial. _If you do add new
functions, please, make a pull request and I will add your contributed code to
the package, and your name as contributor to the package in its DESCRIPTION._

Our R package 'ooacquire' provides a high level set of functions for spectral data
acquisition built using this package as a base.

Package **'ooacquire'** supports most types of *Ocean Optics*
spectrometers from former *Ocean Optics*, now *Ocean Optics*
(<https://www.oceanoptics.com/>). The free runtime of the *OmniDriver
SDP* is no longer supported by Ocean Optics and, thus, no longer
available. The free runtime of the *OmniDriver
SDP* and *Java* need both to be installed before data acquisition is
possible.

## Discontinuation of OmniDriver by Ocean Optics

**Ocean Optics has discontinued support for _OmniDriver_ in mid 2024!**
This means that the runtime has to be downloaded from a "hidden" page in the
Ocean Optics web site at
[https://www.oceanoptics.com/software/resources/discontinued-software/](https://www.oceanoptics.com/software/resources/discontinued-software/).
Discontinuation seems to mean that support for newer models will not be added.
Two versions of OmniDriver are available 2.75 and 2.56. Version 2.75 is the last
released one and does not support very old spectrometers such as USB2000 (not
plus); HR2000 (not plus); ADC1000-USB; S2000; USB650. Version 2.56 was the last
one to support them.

Package 'rOmniDriver' works with both of these versions of OmniDriver (and
several other versions).

### Skipping installation

In package 'rOmniDriver' (>= 0.1.16), when initialization fails during loading,
option `"rOmniDriver.offline"` is set to `TRUE` so that packages that include
this package in their `Suggests:` can detect whether the connection to Java and
the OmniDriver driver are active or not. This makes it possible to disable
specific functions rather than the dependent package failing to load. The
instructions below are to be followed when on-line access to spectrometers is
needed. If this is not the case, Java and OmniDriver do not need to be
installed, and in the case of 'ooacquire', 'rOmniDriver' does not need to be 
installed to use functions that do not depend on an active connection to a
spectrometer.

### Requirements

OmniDriver from Ocean Optics is written in the computer language Java. To
access the functions in this driver from R, we need to use a bridge between the
two computer languages, which is provided by R package 'rJava' available from
CRAN. 'rJava' requires the Java development kit to be installed. installed.
Distributions **Temurin 8 OpenJDK**, **Corretto 8 OpenJDK**, or **Java 8 JDK**
(Java Open development kit) are know to work, as well as some newer versions.
Temurin OpenJDK and Corretto OpenJDK are free distributions, in contrast to
Oracle's Java 8, which has some restrictions and is less frequently updated.

*The Java run-time is not enough!* Thus, being able to run other Java programs
does not ensure that the needed JDK is already installed as needed.

#### Java

Of the different Java implementations, **Oracle's Java 8 JDK**, 
**Temurin 8 OpenJDK** 
([download](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=8)) and **Corretto 8 OpenJDK** ([download](https://corretto.aws/downloads/latest/amazon-corretto-8-x64-windows-jdk.msi)) are known
to work with
'rJava' and **OmniDriver**. The 'rJava' package sometimes fails to work with the
most recent version of the Java JDK, as its updates may lag slightly behind. On
computers with processors and operating systems like Windows that support two
"architectures", 32 bits and 64 bits, R is nowadays only available as a 64 bit binary. The
version of Java installed and the R version used should match, with both 64 bits. 

**Security updates to Oracle's Java 8 JDK are available only through support
contracts. The JDK is free only for personal use, under frequently changing
licence terms.** **Temurin 8 OpenJDK is free for commercial and non-commercial
uses and regularly receives security updates. The OpenJDK is recommended for
use with recent versions of 'rJava'.** When installing the OpenJDK make
sure the `JAVA_HOME` variable and/or registry keys are set. This is not done by
default, but instead needs to be selected during installation. _Be aware that
changing the registry keys can affect the use of other versions of Java if they
are already installed._

Getting R package 'rJava' working is usualy straightforward but can occasionaly 
fail to work automatically. Thus, one needs to
make sure 'rJava' is correctly installed and functional before attempting to
install `rOmniDriver`. This is important, in case problems occur. Sometimes a
restart of the operating system can help.

On Windows, the R distribution (>= 4.2.0) includes only binary packages and R
binary for the 64-bit architecture and the Java/Temurin 8 JDK/Corretto 8
SDK/Adoptium JDK/OpenJDK **x64** installer is needed. The examples and documentation for the
Java JDK are not needed to use 'rOmniDriver'. Under Windows, if the Java/Temurin/Corretto installation fails, uninstall and re install as administrator.

Depending on the operating system, manually setting the environment variable
`"JAVA_HOME"` may be necessary. We can check if this variable is set either at
the operating system command prompt or from R, as shown here. Windows uses a
"registry" to keep track of the location of programs so even if this variable is
not set, 'rJava' will find the Java JDK/Temurin/Corretto OpenJDK under Windows
if the registry keys are correctly set.

```{r}
Sys.getenv("JAVA_HOME")
```

At the OS terminal (such as RStudio's Terminal window) we can check the
currently installed version of the JDK with `javac -version`. Be aware that
`javac` is used for the _JDK_ and `java` for the _JRE_ and for 'rJava', and
consequently also 'rOmniDriver', to work `javac` must be not only installed, but
also in the `path`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
javac -version
```

#### OmniDriver

Once Java is installed and tested working, the next step is to install
'OmniDriver' using the installer downloaded from Ocean Optics's discontinued
software downloads web page. Installers are available for different operating
systems and 32 bit and 64 bit variants. As R is nowadays only available as a 64
bit binary, both the 64 bit Java JDK and 64 bit OmniDriver installer must be
used.

The OmniDriver installer offers a choice between installing the runtime and the
development version. The runtime is free, and is all what is needed to use R
package 'rOmniDriver'. When there is a choice of 32 bit and 64 bit versions,
OmniDriver should match Java and R in this respect. I have done all testing with
the 64 bit version of OmniDriver, together with the 64 bit Java 8 JDK and 64 bit
R under Windows 10. (SPAM is not needed either, so the combined download from
Ocean Optics is overkill.)

After the installation of 'Java' and 'OmniDriver' is completed, the R packages
can be installed. At this point open a _new R session_, or _restart an already
open R session_. I recommend installing first package 'rJava' from CRAN first,
and testing that it works. This installation may fail if the path (folder on
disk) to the Java installation is not found.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rJava")
```

Once this installation has succeeded, and 'rJava' examples tested to work, 
package 'rOmniDriver' and its other dependencies can be installed. 

### 'rOmniDriver'

This package is not available through CRAN as it is a wrapper based on
proprietary software from Ocean Optics with no source code freely available.
'rOmniDriver' can be installed either from a CRAN-like repository at 
_R-Universe_ or from sources directly from the Git repository at _Github_. As
the R-Universe is at most 1 h behind Github, and provides ready-made binaries
for installation, this is the preferred approach.

#### Installation from R-Universe

The "CRAN-like" repository is hosted by the R-Universe. It serves source
packages as well as Windows, OS X (Apple Mac) and Ubuntu binaries.

In recent versions of R, an option can be set to make this
repository visible to R before installing packages as usual. The code below
adds this repository to those already selected.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
repos <- getOption("repos", default = list())
repos[["r4photobiology"]] <- "https://aphalo.r-universe.dev'"
options(repos = repos)
```

After setting the option with the code above, installation does not differ
from that of packages available through CRAN.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rOmniDriver")
```

Alternatively, without setting the option, it is  possible to pass the URL in
the call to `install.packages()`. It is important to also include the URL to
CRAN or one of its mirrors to ensure that all packages 'rOmniDriver' depends on
are installed automatically.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('rOmniDriver', 
                 repos = c('https://aphalo.r-universe.dev', 
                           'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

#### Installation from GitHub

The `main` branch of the Git repository at GitHub is automatically retrieved
by the R-Universe builder and the CRAN-like repository binaries and sources
checked for errors and built. The only reasons to install directly from GitHub
are failure to connect to R-Universe or need to install a development branch
of the code oher than 'main'. Installation from GitHub is possible only from
sources requiring to build the package locallt. **Development branches other
than 'main' are likely to be incomplete or to contain bugs. In most cases,
just useful only for testing new features.** 

Under MS-Windows installation from sources is possible only after installation
from CRAN of a version of Rtools matching the R version in use. Under Linux
operating systems the requirements for installing R packages from source are
usually but not always met by default. Under OS-X compilers may need to be
installed. This requirements are the same as for installing any other R packages
from sources.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("aphalo/romnidriver")
```

Use of the package after a successful installation consists in connecting the
spectrometer through USB and loading the package. The code examples in the
_User Guide_ (package vignette) can be run to test if the installation has
been successful and compatible with the Ocean Optics that will be used.

### If problems arise

The first time you connect an instrument most operating systems will install the
USB drivers automatically, as they are made available by the 'OmniDriver'
installation. If this step fails there are different possibilities: 1) the
account you are logged-in does not have the permissions needed to install the
driver, 2) the user has no permission to write to the USB port through Java, or
3) the spectrometer needs a firmware update for compatibility with newer
versions of the operating system (e.g. some USB2000 spectrometers under Windows
versions newer than 7). These problems are operating-system specific and do also
affect the vendor supplied software to control the spectrometer. If you can
control the spectrometer using the 'OceanView' or the now discontinued
'SpectraSuite' program from Ocean Optics, then Java and the spectrometer
_communication_ drivers (e.g., USB), needed in addition to 'OmniDriver' have
been installed by the OS and working correctly. **On the other hand, there is no
need for 'OceanView' or 'SpectraSuite' to be installed in a computer to be able
to use R package 'rOmniDriver' to communicate and control Ocean Optics
spectrometers.**

The most frequent reason why installation, or functioning of the 'rOmniDriver'
package fails is not finding the path to the installation of OmniDriver. The
'OmniDriver' installer from Ocean Optics is expected to save this path in an
environment variable (in the operating system) called "OOI_HOME", but it not
always does. If necessary we can inspect this variable from within R.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
Sys.getenv("OOI_HOME")
```

The R statement above should show the path to the folder where OmniDriver is
installed. The OmniDriver installer seems to set this variable reliably under
Windows but unreliably under Apple's OS X (Unix) and possibly Linux. If the
variable is undefined or contains an invalid path the user can set or edit it at
the shell prompt or in a shell script run on system start up to point to the
correct folder. Otherwise it can be set within an R script using function
`Sys.setenv(OOI_HOME = <path-to-folder>)` replacing `<path-to-folder>` with
corresponding path. Obviously the variable should be set before loading 
'rOmniDriver'. 

If problems are encountered during loading of 'rOmniDriver' a diagnosis message
is displayed. Display of a diagnosis message in the absence of problems can be
forced by setting `OOI_DIAG = "TRUE"` in the operating system before starting R
or by setting R option verbose with `options(verbose = TRUE)` before loading the
package, as shown below. This will show the location of the `.jar` file loaded
and the values of the environment variables `OOI_HOME` and the path to the
OmniDriver `.jar` file.

```{r}
old.options <- options(verbose = TRUE)
library(rOmniDriver)
options(old.options)
```

The most effective way of contacting the author and maintainer is by raising an
issue at [https://github.com/aphalo/romnidriver/issues](https://github.com/aphalo/romnidriver/issues).

## Documentation

The implemented wrapper functions respect the names of the functions as they
appear in the OmniDriver documentation but replacing "camelCase" with
"snake_case". For a couple of function with very long names, synonyms are
defined in addition to the original names. The documentation for the OmniDriver
API is no longer openly available at the [Ocean Optics web site](https://www.ocaenoptics.com).

This package has a vignette, that can be alternatively built with full output
with a spectrometer connected, or in simplified form with the instrument
off-line. A built version of the documentation is available at
(https://docs.r4photobiology.info/rOmniDriver/).

## Package 'ooacquire'

The functions in the OmniDriver SDP are "bare bones" building blocks that can be
used to write scripts directly, e.g., to acquire one scan every few seconds, or
used to create more sophisticated functions for specific protocols and
applications, of which several examples are provided in package
['ooacquire'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/).

For instructions on how to install package 'ooacquire' please visit [its
web site](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/).

## Status of this package and _OmniDriver_

Package 'rOmniDriver' does NOT require _OceanView_ or _SpectraSuite_, the
commercial software from Ocean Optics to be installed, only the free run-time
of OmniDriver. Consequently, it does not require the purchase of software from
Ocean Optics, but users of the driver OmniDriver run-time are not guaranteed
support by Ocean Optics, unless they acquire a license to the OmniDriver SDP.
OmniDriver is proprietary, closed source, software. The R package itself is
open source and released under GPL.

Packages 'rOmniDriver' and 'ooacquire' have been developed with the agreement
of Ocean Optics on the condition of they remaining open source and free to use. 
The GPL ensures that any derivative works also respect this agreement.

## News

News about updates to this package are regularly posted in the ([Changelog](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/news/)). More generally,
documentation, articles and other content related to R for Photobiology suite 
and the use of R for photobiology-related computations is available at the
[R for Photobiology website](https://www.r4photobiology.info/).
