## Purpose 

The package **rOmniDriver** makes available in R the functions in OmniDriver SDP from Ocean Optics. OmniDriver allows to change settings and acquire spectra using any Ocean Optics USB-connected spectrometer. It has been tested with our _Maya2000Pro_, _Flame_ and _Jaz_ instruments under MS-windows 7 and MS-Windows 10, but should also work with any other modern spectrometer from Ocean Optics, and also under OS X, and Linux. However, only a subset of all OmniDriver exported functions are implemented (those functions that write to the instrument EEPROM are not implemented as they require a secret key for activation, and in addition their use without risk requires a profound understanding of the instruments' hardware and firmware). In addition most functions specific to spectrometer models we do not have access to are not implemented, as we would be unable to test them. As currently the API documentation is freely available at Ocean Optics' support page, adding additional functions using the source code of the functions included in our package as examples is almost trivial. _If you do add new functions, please, make a pull request and I will add your contributed code to the package, and your name as contributor to the package in its DESCRIPTION._

Package **ooacquire** provides a high level set of functions for spectral data acquisition built using this package as a base.

## Installation

OmniDriver from Ocean Optics (now Ocean Insight) is written in Java. To access the functions in this driver from R, we need to a bridge between both languages, given by package 'rJava' available in CRAN. The requirement is not only Java JRE, the runtime environment, but also Java JDK, the development kit to be installed. Java 8 is known to work. On computers with processors that support two command sets, for 32 bits and 64 bits, the version of Java and R should match. On Windows, by default R installs packages for both architectures by default, which means that using the default R installation and settings one needs to install also both versions of the JDK. The examples and documentation for the JDK are not needed. Under Windows, if the installation fails, uninstall and reinstall as administrator.

Once Java is installed and tested working, the next step is to install OmniDriver. The OmniDriver installer offers a choice between installing the free runtime and the development version. The runtime is free, and is all what is needed. Under recent Windows versions I have done all testing with the 64 bit version. SPAM is not needed either, so the combined dowload is overkill.

At this point open an R session, or restart an already open one. I recommend installing first package 'rJava' from CRAN. This installation may fail if the path to the Java installation is not found. Depending on the operating system setting the environment variable "JAVA_HOME" may be necessary.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rJava")
```

Once this installation has succeeded, we can install package 'rOmniDriver' from the Git repository at GitHub For this we use package 'devtools' that needs to be installed unless it has been already installed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("aphalo/romnidriver")
```

The most frequent resean why installation, or functioning of the package fails is not finding the path to the installation of OmniDriver. The installer is expected to set an environment variable in the operating system called "OOI_HOME". If necessary we can inspect it from within R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("OOI_HOME")
```

The statement above should show the path to the folder where OmniDriver is installed. The OmniDriver installer seems to set this variable reliably under Windows but unreliably under Apple's OS X (unix) and possibly Linux. If the varaible is undefined the user can set it at the shell prompt or in a shell script to point to the correct folder.

There is no other set up needed, just plug your spectrometer to an USB port. The first time you connect an instrument the most operating systems will install the drivers as they are made available by the OmniDriver installation. If this step fails there are different possibilities: the account you are logged-in does not have the permissions needed to install the driver or to write to the USB port through Java. How to solve this is operating system specific and related to the use of any software to control the spectrometer.

## Documentation

The implemented wrapper functions respect the names of the functions as they appear in the OmniDriver documentation. For a couple of function with very long names, synonyms are defined in addition to the original names. The documentation for the OmniDriver API is available at (http://oceanoptics.com/api/omnidriver/).

This package has vignettes, that can be alternatively built with full output with a spectrometer connected, or in simplified form with the instrument off-line. A built version of the documentation is available at (https://docs.r4photobiology.info/rOmniDriver/).

## Package 'ooacquire'

The functions in the OmniDriver SDP are "bare bones" building blocks that can be used to write scripts directly, e.g. to acquire one scan every few seconds, or used to create more sophisticated functions for specific protocols and applications, of which several examples are provided in package ['ooacquire'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/). It can be installed with this statement.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("aphalo/ooacquire")
```

## Status of this package and _OmniDriver_

Package 'rOmniDriver' does NOT require _OceanView_ or _SpectraSuite_, the commercial software from Ocean Optics to be installed, only the free run-time of OmniDriver. Consequently, it does not require the purchase of software from Ocean Optics, but users of the driver OmniDriver run-time are not guaranteed support by Ocean Optics, unless they acquire a license to the OmniDriver SDP. OmniDriver is proprietary, closed source, software. The R package itself is released under GPL.

## In case of problems

The source code of the package is open, and available through Bitbucket. Please report any problems or bugs by creating a new issue at (https://github.com/aphalo/photobiology/issues). Contributions and reports of compatibility or lack of it with different spectrometers and operating systems are very welcome.
